        "The Indian Penal Code is the main criminal code of India. It covers all substantive aspects of criminal law. "
        "It defines various offenses and provides punishments for them, such as 'offences against the human body' (e.g., murder, assault), 'offences against property' (e.g., theft, robbery), and 'offences against the state'."
