    "Indian Police System": (
        "Overview of the organisation of law enforcement in India: the role of the Central Government, State Police, and paramilitary forces. "
        "State Police are primary law enforcement agencies; the Union has apex bodies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), National Investigation Agency (NIA), and paramilitary forces for specific roles."
    ),
    "Police Ranks & Structure": (
        "Ranks range from Constable -> Head Constable -> Sub-Inspector -> Inspector -> Superintendent of Police (SP) -> Deputy Inspector General -> Inspector General etc. "
        "Leadership, organisational structure, and distribution of responsibilities differ between states and central forces."
    ),
    "Rights of Citizens & Police Duties": (
        "Important: citizens have constitutional rights such as the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21). Police duties include protecting life and property, preventing and investigating offences, and maintaining public order. "
        "Complaints against police are handled by state mechanisms (e.g. human rights commissions, police complaint authorities) â€” recent legal frameworks emphasize accountability and transparency."
    ),
    "Investigation Basics": (
        "Investigation stages: First information report (FIR), preliminary inquiry, evidence collection, arrest (with legal safeguards), charge-sheet, and court proceedings. "
        "Investigation must follow procedure under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and relevant laws; collection of forensics and digital evidence is increasingly important."
    ),
    "Cybercrime & Modern Challenges": (
        "Cybercrime is handled under the Information Technology Act and IPC sections relating to fraud, hacking, identity theft, and harassment. "
        "Specialised cyber cells and training are critical as crimes shift online."
